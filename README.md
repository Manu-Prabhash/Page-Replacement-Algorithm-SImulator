### 🛡️ OS Memory Management Visualization
A desktop application built to simulate and visualize how Operating Systems manage memory through Page Replacement. This tool helps in understanding the efficiency of different algorithms by calculating page faults and displaying the real-time state of memory frames.

## 📌 Project Highlights

* **Multi-Algorithm Support:** Simulate three core OS algorithms: **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)**, **OPR (Optimal Page Replacement)**, and **LRU (Least Recently Used)**.
* **Interactive GUI:** Built with **Tkinter**, featuring a user-friendly dashboard to input custom page sequences and frame sizes.
* **Step-by-Step Visualization:** Displays the state of the memory frames after every single page request.
* **Fault Calculation:** Automatically calculates the total number of Page Faults to compare algorithm performance.

## 📊 Algorithms Explained



1.  **FCFS (FIFO):** Replaces the oldest page in the frame (the one that arrived first).
2.  **LRU:** Replaces the page that has not been used for the longest period of time.
3.  **Optimal (OPR):** Replaces the page that will not be used for the longest period of time in the future.
